Kolokwa Connect: A crowdsourced and AI-powered platform for the preservation and learning of Kolokwa (Liberian English). We will build the Minimal Viable Product (MVP) of a crowdsourcing web app that allows Liberians to contribute and verify Kolokwa words, creating the foundational, culturally-rich dataset needed to train an accurate, context-aware AI translation and learning model.
