Kolokwa Connect: A crowdsourced and AI-powered platform for the preservation and learning of Kolokwa (Liberian English). We will build the Minimal Viable Product (MVP) of a crowdsourcing web app that allows Liberians to contribute and verify Kolokwa words, creating the foundational, culturally-rich dataset needed to train an accurate, context-aware AI translation and learning model.

Our project impact includes:
Linguistic & Cultural Preservation: Kolokwa Connect will establish the first robust, digital archive for an unstandardized, vibrant African language, ensuring its continuity.
‎
‎Digital Inclusion: It will create an accessible resource for learning, translating, and communicating, lowering barriers for both Liberians and international stakeholders.
‎
‎Data Sovereignty: By crowdsourcing data from the community, our project empowers Liberians to be the owners and architects of their own linguistic data, setting a precedent for low-resource language development in Africa.
